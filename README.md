# yichun-s-cypher
The program "Yichun's Cypher" encrypts messages using ASCII Code written in Python.

The original idea is based on the Vigen√®re cipher. It was part of my assignment for my computer science course. The original program only encrypts one ltter at a time. I have modified it to make it interactive and to allow it to read a string for both the key and the message no matter the length of the key or message.
