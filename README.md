# yichun-s-cypher
The program "Yichun's Cypher" encrypts messages using ASCII Code written in Python.

The original idea is based on the Vigen√®re cipher. It was part of my assignment for my computer science course. The original program only encrypts one ltter at a time. I have decided to challenge myself and modified the original program to make it interactive and to allow it to read a string for both the key and the message no matter how long the key or message is.

I have also created the program ""Yichun's Reverse-cypher" to decrypt messages that were encrypted using ASCII Code.

Fun stuff :D
